<p>Hi my name is Jonathan and I was a secondary school music teacher for 24 years. I am now doing some supply
    teaching for a little bit of income whilst doing this course.</p>
    <p>I got into coding through a developer friend which conveniently tied in with the desperate need to get out of teaching. I needed a new career and it was now or never!</p>
